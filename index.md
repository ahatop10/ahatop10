## Invest

> The great truth is simple, and keeping to the right path is extraordinary: <ins>Income = Capital * (1 + interest rate) <sup>Duration</sup></ins>

1. It is not easy to make money in the stock market
2. Invest requires capital, cognition, time, and understanding and overcoming human weaknesses, but it is not out of reach
3. The market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term.
4. The final performance of the stock price depends on and only depends on the fundamentals of the company
5. The basic skills of investment are actually to understand the company and the business, nothing else
6. Do the right thing and do things right
7. Price is what you pay, value is what you get
8. A gentleman loves money, and he gets it in a "way", and "way" is his duty
9. Taste the sweetness, eat the bitterness, things teach people, and actual combat brings true knowledge

### Yes

1. <ins>**Buying stocks means buying a company**</ins>
2. <ins>**Buy profitable companies**</ins>
3. <ins>**Focus on core indicators: whether it makes money**</ins>
4. whether the price-earnings ratio is high, whether the industry prospects are good, whether there is a moat,
5. whether there is a dividend, whether the price is high or low
6. The cost of buying is as low as possible
7. Dynamically adjust the candidate resource pool and the allocation of held assets
8. Discuss with yourself in the mirror, rather than following the crowd
9. There are always opportunities for investment, no need to rush, and you can't rush
10. Be rational and do the right thing
11. Be patient and wait for investment targets to appear in your circle of competence, including actively looking for them in your circle of competence
12. Find a good company and then "buy to keep"
13. Right Business + Right People + Right Price
14. Great companies are like antiques, becoming more and more valuable.
15. The essence of business is the cooperation and mutual benefit of relevant stakeholders
16. An outstanding company can predict what may happen in the future, but it does not necessarily know when it will happen
17. Great companies: companies that can still maintain their great status in 25 or 30 years
18. I like a company that has a sustainable competitive advantage and is managed by a group of people who are both capable and wholeheartedly serve shareholders
19. When people forget the most basic common sense that "two plus two equals four", it is time to get out of the market
20. Diversification is a protective umbrella for ignorance
21. The so-called financial freedom is not to have a lot of money, but not to do things you don't like for money

### No

1. ~~No borrowing for investment~~
2. ~~Don't buy industries and companies you are familiar with~~
3. ~~Don't buy just because the price is cheap~~
4. Cheap things are often more expensive, and free is the most expensive
5. If you are already in a pit, don't dig any further
6. People with high IQs may not know where the boundaries of their circle of competence are
7. People with high IQs may often go beyond their circle of competence
8. Even people with a large circle of competence will be miserable outside their circle of competence
9. We don't know what we don't know.
10. There is no formula to calculate the intrinsic value of a company. You have to really understand the company
11. Today's investors do not profit from yesterday's growth, so they cannot invest based on past PE or PEG
12. Products must be differentiated, otherwise there will be fierce price competition in the end
13. Don't want to buy the worst furniture at the cheapest price, buy the best furniture at a reasonable price
14. Running on the wrong path is useless.
