## Invest

> The great truth is simple, and keeping to the right path is extraordinary: <ins>Income = Capital * (1 + interest rate) <sup>Duration</sup></ins>

1. It is not easy to make money in the stock market
2. Invest requires capital, cognition, time, and understanding and overcoming human weaknesses, but it is not out of reach
3. The market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term.
4. The final performance of the stock price depends on and only depends on the fundamentals of the company
5. The basic skills of investment are actually to understand the company and the business, nothing else
6. Do the right thing and do things right
7. Price is what you pay, value is what you get
8. A gentleman loves money, and he gets it in a "way", and "way" is his duty
9. Taste the sweetness, eat the bitterness, things teach people, and actual combat brings true knowledge

### Yes

1. <ins>**Buying stocks means buying a company**</ins>
2. <ins>**Buy profitable companies**</ins>
3. <ins>**Focus on core indicators: whether it makes money**</ins>
4. whether the price-earnings ratio is high, whether the industry prospects are good, whether there is a moat,
5. whether there is a dividend, whether the price is high or low
6. The cost of buying is as low as possible
7. Dynamically adjust the candidate resource pool and the allocation of held assets
8. Discuss with yourself in the mirror, rather than following the crowd
9. There are always opportunities for investment, no need to rush, and you can't rush
10. Be rational and do the right thing
11. Be patient and wait for investment targets to appear in your circle of competence, including actively looking for them in your circle of competence
12. Find a good company and then "buy to keep"
13. Right Business + Right People + Right Price
14. Great companies are like antiques, becoming more and more valuable.
15. The essence of business is the cooperation and mutual benefit of relevant stakeholders
16. An outstanding company can predict what may happen in the future, but it does not necessarily know when it will happen
17. Great companies: companies that can still maintain their great status in 25 or 30 years
18. I like a company that has a sustainable competitive advantage and is managed by a group of people who are both capable and wholeheartedly serve shareholders
19. When people forget the most basic common sense that "two plus two equals four", it is time to get out of the market
20. Diversification is a protective umbrella for ignorance
21. The so-called financial freedom is not to have a lot of money, but not to do things you don't like for money

### No

1. ~~No borrowing for investment~~
2. ~~Don't buy industries and companies you are familiar with~~
3. ~~Don't buy just because the price is cheap~~
4. Cheap things are often more expensive, and free is the most expensive
5. If you are already in a pit, don't dig any further
6. People with high IQs may not know where the boundaries of their circle of competence are
7. People with high IQs may often go beyond their circle of competence
8. Even people with a large circle of competence will be miserable outside their circle of competence
9. We don't know what we don't know.
10. There is no formula to calculate the intrinsic value of a company. You have to really understand the company
11. Today's investors do not profit from yesterday's growth, so they cannot invest based on past PE or PEG
12. Products must be differentiated, otherwise there will be fierce price competition in the end
13. Don't want to buy the worst furniture at the cheapest price, buy the best furniture at a reasonable price
14. Running on the wrong path is useless.

> 投资参考团成员：李笑来，香帅，何刚，吴军，Guru，段永平

1. A股2025年有概率上4千，故多配置基金
2. 房地产阵痛可能持续到2030年，不买房不投资，不熟不碰
3. 当前美股处于估值高位，eft基金收益率可能低于10%，定投，做好长期持有的准备
4. 美元仍旧强势，贸易战风险持续存在，做好资产配置及风险对冲
5. β收益的重点：基金板块均衡，深圳，上海，港股；科创板等
6. α收益的重点：科技股，如，ai，新能源，互联网

三套资产配置方案

方案一：保守防御型
**配置比例：美股20% + 港股40% + A股30% + 黄金ETF 10%**

理由：低配美股：规避贸易摩擦升级对美股的潜在冲击。
侧重港股：利用港股“避风港”属性（估值低、利空消化充分）和与A股的联动性。
A股精选内需：聚焦消费、基建等政策受益板块，对冲出口链风险。
黄金对冲：配置黄金ETF抵御市场波动和汇率风险。

---

方案二：平衡灵活型
**配置比例：美股30% + 港股35% + A股30% + 现金5%**

理由：美股中性：短期关税冲击可控，可配置防御性行业（公用事业、必需消费）和科技龙头（业绩确定性高）。
港股核心持仓：通过恒生科技指数基金布局超跌科技股，同时持有高股息国企（如能源、电信）平衡风险。
A股结构性增配：加仓进口替代（半导体设备、工业母机）和新能源（海外依赖度低）。
保留现金：预留机动资金，应对关税政策反复带来的市场回调机会。

---

方案三：积极进取型
**配置比例：美股15% + 港股25% + A股50% + 跨境ETF 10%**

理由：
超跌A股为主线：关税幅度温和（10%）且政策对冲预期强（财政发力、地产纾困），逢低布局宽基指数（如MSCI A50 ETF）和国产替代主题基金。
港股弹性品种：配置港股互联网龙头（估值修复）和生物医药（与关税关联度低）。
美股低配：仅保留必需消费和医疗等防御性行业ETF。
跨境ETF分散风险：通过中概股ETF或新兴市场基金分散单一市场风险。

---
总结建议

短期：优先方案一或二，控制美股敞口，利用港股和A股内需板块对冲关税风险。
中长期：若中国政策刺激见效，可逐步向方案三倾斜，把握A股估值修复和国产替代主线。
动态调整：密切关注3月中国两会政策细节、美国大选进展及贸易谈判动向，灵活调整仓位。
